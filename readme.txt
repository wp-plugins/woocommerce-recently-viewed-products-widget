**Plugin Woocommerce Viewed Products Widget** - Recently viewed products is an incredibly powerful feature simply because it’s, for me, sort of very basic artificial intelligence. It allows users to easily go back to products they already viewed in just a matter of seconds. And the fact to use a Widget to display recently viewed products is great because you can place it everywhere in your website.
